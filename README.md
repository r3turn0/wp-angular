## Developer Notes - JOHN ERICTA

For local development I used Wamp64 in conjuction with Wordpress and Angular 5.2.10 (w/ Angular-CLI 1.7.4).

I used Yarn to manage my packages. When you pull the project do a yarn install.

Use the buildProd/buildTest.cmd for deployment. Change the urls accordingly.

Finally adjust appropriately the project name and environments.

Please note that this is a bare example of how to use Angular5+ with Wordpress API. This is the framework I used for my own website www.johnericta.com and other configurations were needed in the admin panel of Wordpress such as ordering the pages.
